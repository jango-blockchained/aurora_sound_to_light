# Cursor Rules

## General Cursor Files

! Use `@.cursorrules` to track rules
! Use `@.cursorfiles` to track files
! Use `@.cursortasks` to track tasks
! Use `@.cursorignore` to track ignored files

## General Principles
- Use clear, actionable descriptions
- Prioritize tasks with urgency and importance
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps

## Cursor Notation
- `!` = High Priorit
- `*` = In Progress
- `?` = Needs Clarification
- `~` = Blocked/Waiting
- `✓` = Completed
- `>` = Delegated/Assigned

### Example Syntax

! Implement core feature
* Refactor authentication module
? Clarify API endpoint requirements
~ Waiting on external dependency
✓ Completed minor bug fix
> Assigned to team member

## Task Lifecycle
- Start with a clear, concise task description
- Add context and specific requirements
- Track dependencies and blockers
- Update status regularly

## Best Practices
- Review and update tasks frequently
- Use consistent formatting
- Keep tasks specific and measurable
- Include estimated time or complexity
- Link to relevant documentation or tickets

## Project-Specific Notes
- Home Assistant runs in `homeassistant` Docker container
- Project located at `/config/custom_components/aurora_sound_to_light`
- Volume-mounted for direct file synchronization

## Tasks File @.cursortasks Guidelines

### Purpose
- Comprehensive project tracking document
- High-level overview of project progress
- Serves as a roadmap and status tracker

### When to Review
- Before starting new development cycles

### When to Update
- After completing significant milestones
- When adding new features or components
- Adjusting project scope
- Reflecting changes in project priorities
- After completing new features and tests, update @README.md if needed

### Update Best Practices
- Use checkboxes `[ ]` and `[x]` for tracking
- Add detailed subtasks
- Include estimated timelines
- Mark completed items
- Add context for complex tasks
- Use emoji for visual categorization

### Notation Recommendations
- `🚀` = Project Milestones
- `🎯` = Core Components
- `🎨` = Design/UI Tasks
- `🧪` = Testing
- `📚` = Documentation
- `🔄` = Optimization
- `🐛` = Bug Tracking
- `🔒` = Security Tasks

### Tracking Workflow
1. Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable items
2. Prioritize tasks using cursor notation
3. Update status regularly
4. Maintain clear, actionable descriptions
5. Link to relevant issues or pull requests
