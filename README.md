## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Home Assistant Core 2023.x or newer
- Python 3.9+
- FFmpeg
- Sufficient CPU resources for audio processing

### HACS Installation (Recommended)
1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click on "Integrations"
3. Click the "+" button
4. Search for "Aurora Sound to Light"
5. Click "Install"
6. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation
1. Download the latest release
2. Copy the `custom_components/aurora_sound_to_light` directory to your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration
```yaml
aurora_sound_to_light:
  audio_input: microphone  # or media_player
  light_groups:
    - name: Living Room
      lights:
        - light.living_room_1
        - light.living_room_2
    - name: Kitchen
      lights:
        - light.kitchen_strip
```

### Advanced Configuration
```yaml
aurora_sound_to_light:
  audio_input: microphone
  buffer_size: 100
  latency_threshold: 50
  frequency_bands: 32
  color_preferences:
    primary: [255, 0, 0]
    secondary: [0, 0, 255]
  transition_speed: 1.5
```

## Usage

### Control Panel
Access the Aurora control panel through Home Assistant's interface to:
- View real-time frequency visualization
- Manage light groups
- Select and customize effects
- Monitor system performance
- Create and manage scenes

### Creating Custom Effects
1. Navigate to the Effect Creator in the control panel
2. Choose base effect type
3. Adjust parameters and timing
4. Test and save your creation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **High Latency**: Adjust buffer size or check network connectivity
- **CPU Usage**: Reduce frequency bands or number of active lights
- **Audio Detection**: Check microphone permissions and placement

### Performance Optimization
- Use wired network connections when possible
- Group lights by physical location
- Adjust transition speeds for smoother effects
